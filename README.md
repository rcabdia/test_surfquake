# Test case for surfQuake 

In core library the user will find the scripts designed to run a full surfQuake example. From making a project, picking phase up to MTI. The equivalent approach is found as a Command Line Interface inside folder CLI.

Just replace folder paths hardcoded in the scripts by user **absolute paths**. 
Original outputs are inside the folder outputs, we recommend that the user follow the same structure (no mandatory of course)
